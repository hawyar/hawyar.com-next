## Overview

**Mou**, the missing Markdown editor for _web developers_.

### Syntax

#### Strong and Emphasize

**strong** or _emphasize_

> Right angle brackets &gt; are used for block quotes.

An email <example@example.com> link.

Simple inline link <http://chenluois.com>, another inline link [Smaller](http://smallerapp.com),

#### Inline code and Block code

Inline code are surround by `backtick` key. To create a block code:

Indent each line by at least 1 tab, or 4 spaces.
var Mou = exactlyTheAppIwant;

#### Ordered Lists

Ordered lists are created using "1." + Space:

1. Ordered list item
2. Ordered list item
3. Ordered list item

#### Unordered Lists

Unordered list are created using "\*" + Space:

- Unordered list item
- Unordered list item
- Unordered list item

#### Headers

Setext-style:

# This is H1

## This is H2

atx-style:

# This is H1

## This is H2

### This is H3

#### This is H4

##### This is H5

###### This is H6

### Extra Syntax

#### Footnotes

Footnotes work mostly like reference-style links. A footnote is made of two things: a marker in the text that will become a superscript number; a footnote definition that will be placed in a list of footnotes at the end of the document. A footnote looks like this:

That's some text with a footnote.[^1]

[^1]: And that's the footnote.

#### Strikethrough

Wrap with 2 tilde characters:

~~Strikethrough~~

#### Fenced Code Blocks

Start with a line containing 3 or more backticks, and ends with the first line with the same number of backticks:

```js
const temp = {};

function cerate() {
  return temp;
}
```

#### Tables

A simple table looks like this:

| First Header | Second Header | Third Header |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| Content Cell | Content Cell  | Content Cell |
| Content Cell | Content Cell  | Content Cell |

If you wish, you can add a leading and tailing pipe to each line of the table:

| First Header | Second Header | Third Header |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| Content Cell | Content Cell  | Content Cell |
| Content Cell | Content Cell  | Content Cell |

Specify alignement for each column by adding colons to separator lines:

| First Header | Second Header | Third Header |
| :----------- | :-----------: | -----------: |
| Left         |    Center     |        Right |
| Left         |    Center     |        Right |
